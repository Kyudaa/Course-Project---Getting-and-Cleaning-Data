This repository is my submission for the Course Project of the Coursera course: "Getting and Cleaning Data". It includes the following:

1. R-Script "run_analysis.R" -> shows all the code that is used for transforming the data from raw to tidy, while introducing several variables in the process

2. "CodeBook.md" -> detailed description of the transformations and variables used in the R-Script
